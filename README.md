The idea of â€‹â€‹this project is to create a tool for universities and scientific institutions with the aim of uniting and disseminating knowledge about nanoscience. Especially focused on the analysis of data from atomic simulations carried out on nanoparticles. As a pilot test, the tool is developed and tested with information from simulations of gold nanoclusters and nanoparticles.

The main function of the application is to allow teachers and researchers to load the configurations of the possible good calculators to perform structural and energy calculations. it is also possible to load their respective results. Finally, it gives students the possibility to visualize, analyze and study the available information and contribute with little a results that they made as part of theirs studies.

## Future Work

The work has many Coming soon, like project and calculators search engines by different attributes such as ids, titles, creators.

In addition, each user should have their pages where they have direct access to the data they provided.

Teachers would have their list of projects, calculators and also their students and their respective completed projects.

And the students could have the list of their completed projects and those of their professors.

It could also have data on other nanomaterials. Not just Nano gold. There is also extensive information on calculations on nanoclusters or nanoparticles of silver, platinum, copper, among others.

Finally, it would be interesting to plot different selected projects on the same graph in order to compare the efficiency of their calculators.
